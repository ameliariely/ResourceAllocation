REU MedIX Project 2014 Kyle and Amelia

Welcome to RESOURCE ALLOCATION!!!

Here are a bunch of files that we have used over the course of our project and may or may not be interesting to you. See our paper for a description of the experiment and how it worked.

For a basic run of experiment, first run InitializationCombinedGabor.R and then Exp3_Main.R. We used RStudio, a program you can download online. It might give you a few errors if you don't have all the packages installed, so just watch for red and use Google to fix things. Those two files should do most of what is described in our paper. Some of the graphs come from the Variances.R file, and most of them (and more) are saved in this folder as well. Some materials we used to learn R are in the LearningR folder. Parameter tuning is in TuningAGAIN.R. You change g at the beginning of the file to the iteration that you're trying to tune. The parameter matrix will be output with training and testing accuracies and you can use it to select the parameters with the best performance. 

The experiment is based off an experiment by Thomas (Xiaotao) Fang. His code is in Initialization.R and Main Program.KCCA.R.

Please feel free to email us at amelia.riely@gmail.com and kyle.sablan@gmail.com. We spent a lot of time on this and we know how confusing it can be (especially when dealing with other people's code), so we'd be happy to help!!
